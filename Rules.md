## Rules ##

The development will be open and have some rules to maintain the quality and purpose:

  * The design should follow the specifications of the XH's API, adjusted to the capabilities of Delphi.
  * All code must have tests
    * DUnit
    * DSharp.Testing.Mock
  * It must have documentation or at least the reference to existing documentation on XH.
  * The trunk should always be buildable, even though the feature is not finalized.
  * The code should be formatted according to the rules defined. A document with the rules will be published along with the Delphi formatting configuration file.
  * For collaboration to be accepted, a review of the code should be requested. Only after the reviewers approve, the code will be added to the main repository.
  * A demo program is desired. It should be buildable and with all dependencies included.

More rules to be added.
