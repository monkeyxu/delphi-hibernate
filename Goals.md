# DHibernate Project #

  * OPF/ORM based on Hibernate and NHibernate.

## Goals ##

The Jazz SDK project needed to be renewed, and since it was published, Hibernate and NHibernate became more popular and mature, so it was natural to use the existing design and experience in this new version, so users and developers could use their existing knowledge.

From this point on, "**XH**" will be used as an abbreviation for "**Hibernate and NHibernate**".

The development is being done with Delphi XE2. Several resources used are only available for Delphi 2010 or newer. Only after testing the entire framework in each version of Delphi, I can tell which versions will be officially supported, and I hope to have the help of collaborators to these tests.

[DSharp](http://code.google.com/p/delphisorcery) framework will be used to avoid duplication of functionality, leaving more time to focus on the unique features of the ORM. Thanks to the author of DSharp, Stefan Glienke, for authorizing me to use this wonderful library.
