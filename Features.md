  * Author: Cesar Romero - cesarliws@gmail.com
  * Document reviewer: Istvan Agoston

## Features ##

  * A version with the features of latest version of XH is planned, but at the time only a subset of these features are selected which are required for current projects.
  * All selected features will follow the model already defined in XH, being adjusted to the capabilities of Delphi.
  * Any other feature used should follow the XH model, any other suggestion will be reviewed before being accepted.
